# TokenScout

An application that analyzes ERC20 tokens on a Base chain (or any EVM chain with adjustments). It provides insights into potential honeypots, checks for ERC20 compliance, and estimates buy and sell taxes (if the contract exposes this information on-chain).

## Features

- Estimates buy and sell tax for ERC20 tokens (Base Chain)
- Basic honeypot detection (Spam token)
- **[Moralis Integration](https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api/evm/reference/wallet-api/get-token-balances-by-wallet):** Utilizes the Moralis API for comprehensive blockchain data.

## Pre-requisites

- VS Code or any Code Editor
- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm package manager
- RPC URL

## Technology Stack

- Web3.js
- Nextjs
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started
